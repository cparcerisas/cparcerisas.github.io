I am a post-doc researchers at the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), in Belgium. 

I recently received my PhD at Ghent University (and VLIZ) in June 2024, under the supervision of Prof. Dick Botteldooren, Prof. Paul Devos and Dr. Elisabeth Debusschere. 

I like developing open-source tools for marine bioacoustics analysis.
